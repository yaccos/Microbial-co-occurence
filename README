Welcome to the computations for the article "Robust bacterial co-occurence community structures are independent of $r$- and $K$-selection history"

This repository assumes you have R version 4.1.1 running, although somewhat older versions should also work. Running these scripts requires quite some packages, the most important of which is micInt which is available on GitHub (https://github.com/AlmaasLab/micInt). The other packages required are either on CRAN or Bioconductor. A complete pipeline can be found in master_script.R. The top of this script also includes (commented out) the procedure to restore the required packages to their proper versions. Note that R must a suitable C++ configured to run the pipeline.
 

The most imporant analysis scripts are:
 - read_selection_switch.R Modify the dataset for analysis
 - prepare_analysis.R Create jobs for ReBoot algorithm
 - run_HUNT_computations.R . This script is is supposed to run on a compute cluster, not locally as it requires hours to run and ~ 100 GB of memory


The most relevant visualisation scripts to look into are:
 - export_interaction_count_ss.R for the threshold figures
 - generate_community_label_ss.R for the network of interactions and the phylogram
 - community_dynamics.R for the dynamic PCoA ordinartions
 - create_community_label_ss_robustness.R which does the same as the former three scripts, but for the combinations of parameters
 
Please also note that the intermediate files can take gigabytes of space.
